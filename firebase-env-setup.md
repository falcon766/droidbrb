# Firebase Environment Variables Setup

## The Issue
Your app is currently loading indefinitely because Firebase environment variables are not configured. The app needs these variables to connect to your Firebase project.

## How to Fix

### 1. Create a `.env` file
Create a file called `.env` in the `client` directory with the following content:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
```

### 2. Get Your Firebase Config Values
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Project Settings** > **General**
4. Scroll down to **"Your apps"** section
5. If you don't have a web app, click **"Add app"** and choose **Web**
6. Copy the config values from the provided configuration object

### 3. Replace the Placeholder Values
Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with your actual Firebase config values.

### 4. Restart the Development Server
After creating the `.env` file, restart your development server:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

### 5. For Production (Netlify)
You'll also need to add these environment variables to your Netlify project:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Site settings** > **Environment variables**
4. Add each variable from your `.env` file

## Current Status
The app now has better error handling and will show helpful error messages in the browser console if Firebase variables are missing. However, you still need to set up the actual Firebase project and environment variables for full functionality.

## Testing Locally
You can now test the app locally at `http://localhost:3000` once you've set up the environment variables.
